        <p>Agriculture in India like in most developing countries is plagued with many problems. Be it the small land holding size of poor farmers, which is 100X less when compared to their counterparts in the US (which makes mechanization of these farms counterproductive) or be it the lack of education on the state of the art in farming and the agribusiness in general (which the current agri-extension systems are failing to solve) and because of this information asymmetry along with the numerous decisions that farmer has to take (which farmer has little knowledge about) is stunting their productivity. Farmers are disadvantaged and are not able to run a sustainable agribusiness.</p>

        <p>Farmi is an infrastructure platform for agribusinesses which helps them scale their backward integration with farmers and help farmers earn more by increasing their productivity and farm yield. We are doing this by using precision agriculture, and data driven input and output linkages.</p>

        </p>Norman Borloug - The father of green revolution, is directly responsible for saving the lives of over a billion people for which he was awarded the nobel peace prize. The population growth that our generation has witnessed is over 2.2 billion and estimates say that it is going to grow by another 2 billion in the next 20 years. It is time we have a revolution which is at the intersection of technology and agronomy to ensure the continued sustenance of the human race.</p>
